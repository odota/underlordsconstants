When at least one level of that Alliance is enabled, when an Ace unit appears in the Shop, the odds of it being the Ace unit associated with that Alliance is increased by 15%.",

When they fight on the board alongside other heroes who share the same Alliance, the crew receives an Alliance bonus. This could either make your crew stronger in some way, or your opponent’s crew weaker in some way. Many Alliances have multiple levels of strength that can be reached when you have more unique heroes from that Alliance on your board. For instance a level 1 Brawny Alliance is reached with two heroes, and a level 2 Brawny Alliance can be reached with four heroes. Higher level Alliances offer better benefits to your crew.",

In addition, bonus gold can earned from win streaks, lose streaks, and items.

Each Underlord also has a unique trait that allows them to generate additional Hype - for instance, Hobgen generates more hype if more of his crew is on fire.",

The Shop odds change with your level as well – more powerful heroes will appear in the Shop as you level up.
